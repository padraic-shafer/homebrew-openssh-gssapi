  def caveats

        keychain-support with ssh-agent keys:
        NOTE: replacing system daemons is unsupported. Proceed at your own risk.
        See also some warnings here: https://github.com/rdp/homebrew-openssh-gssapi/issues/1

        For complete functionality, please modify:
          /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist

        and change ProgramArguments from
          /usr/bin/ssh-agent
        to
          #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/ssh-agent

        You will need to restart or issue the following commands
        for the changes to take effect:

          launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist
          launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist

        Finally, add  these lines somewhere to your ~/.bash_profile:
          eval $(ssh-agent)

          function cleanup {
            echo "Killing SSH-Agent"
            kill -9 $SSH_AGENT_PID
          }

          trap cleanup EXIT

        After that, you can start storing private key passwords in
        your OS X Keychain.
